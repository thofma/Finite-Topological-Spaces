# Finite Topological Spaces
_Author: Ximena Fernandez_

**Finite_Spaces** is a SAGE module to work with Finite Topological Spaces.
We refer to [1] for the theoretical background and proofs of the correctness of the algorithms.

In [2], we developed a method to study Q**-transformations of group presentations based on finite spaces and a refinement of discrete Morse theory. It was applied to prove that potential counterexamples to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture do satisfy the conjecture. The computational experiments can be reproduced at **Potential_counterexamples_AC.ipynb**

Discrete Morse Theory for 3-deformations of 2-complexes in based in the notion of _internal collapse_ showed at the following animation.
