# Finite Topological Spaces
_Author: Ximena Fernandez_

**Finite_Spaces** is a SAGE module to work with Finite Topological Spaces.
We refer to [1] for the theoretical background and proofs of the correctness of the algorithms.

We developed a method to study Q**-transformations of group presentations based on finite spaces and a refinement of discrete Morse theory. It was applyied to prove that protential counterexamples to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture do satisfy the conjecture [2]. The computational experiments can be found at **Potential_counterexamples_AC.ipynb**

Discrete Morse Theory for 3-deformations of 2-complexes in based in the notion of _internal collapses_.
