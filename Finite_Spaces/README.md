This is the source code of the SAGE Module for Finite Topological Spaces. Find below a short description of the aim of the functions implemented in each submodule.

* **General:** Basic operations between finite topological spaces.

* **Homotopy:** Computation of homotopy type and simple homotopy type of finite topological spaces.

* **Deformations:** Reduction methods preserving the simple homotopy type of a finite space.

* **Presentations:** Computation of the poset associated to a group presentation.

* **Colorings:** A method based on colorings to compute a presentation of the fundamental group of a poset. If the poset is associated to a presentation P, the method returns a presentation P' that is Q**-equivalent to P.

* **Morse:** A method based in discrete Morse theory to compute a presentation Q**-equivalent to a given one.
